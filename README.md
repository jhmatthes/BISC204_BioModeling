# BISC204_BioModeling
BISC 204: Biological Modeling is a course developed by Jackie Matthes at Wellesley College to introduce undergraduates to modeling for dynamic biological systems. The lab coding exercises were designed for sophomore/junior level undergraduates with no prior coding experience. 

Labs 2-5 are spread over two weeks each, so there is an "A" lab for week 1 and "B" lab for week 2 in each folder, and lab sessions are ~3 hours.

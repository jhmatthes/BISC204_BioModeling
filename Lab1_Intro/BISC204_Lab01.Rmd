### 1.  Objectives

- Understand how to create an Rstudio workspace. 
- Make visualizations of data with R.
- Interpret and write the syntax (vocabulary and grammar) for some basic math tasks in R.


### 2. Code Organization

As the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer. Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. Today we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands.

Throughout this course we are going to develop skills in the best practices for reproducible scientfic research, and that starts with setting up personal systems of organization for maintaining code and data for your lab projects. This is critical because when we write code, we have to tell the computer where to find our data files, and this is SO MUCH easier if we organize things ahead of time. Future you will thank present you for doing this! 

Within the R server space, you should maintain a separate folder for each lab assignment (folders are also called 'directories' in CS-speak), and keep all of your code and data together within that folder for each lab. This will be relatively easy to do, because when you upload the .zip file for each lab to the server, it should automatically unzip into a folder for each lab. Use this folder to add your own code as we go through lab assignments, and keep a folder called `data/` within each lab folder to hold the data that are associated with that lab. Let's all make sure that you have an unzipped `BISC204_Lab01` folder in your server space right now, and confirm that there is a folder called `data/` inside. 

### 3. Rstudio Interface

One of the goals of this lab is to introduce you to R and RStudio, which you'll be using
throughout the course both to learn the concepts discussed in class and to analyze real data and models. To straighten out which is which: R is the name of the programming language itself 
and RStudio is a convenient interface.

![rinterface](data/rInterface2014.png)

The panel in the upper right contains your *Environment* (workspace) as well as a history of 
the commands that you've previously entered. Any plots that you generate will 
show up in the panel in the lower right corner.

The panel on the left is where the action happens. It's called the *console*. 
Everytime you launch RStudio, it will have the same text at the top of the 
console telling you the version of R that you're running.  Below that information
is the *prompt*. As its name suggests, this prompt is really a request, a 
request for a command.  Initially, interacting with R is all about typing commands
and interpreting the output. These commands and their syntax have evolved over
decades (literally) and now provide what many users feel is a fairly natural way
to access data and organize, describe, and invoke statistical computations.

### 4. Saving Code in an R Script File

Once you've confirmed that your directories are in the right spot (from the Code Organization section above), it's time to start making R files. The first thing we'll do within Rstudio is to create an Rstudio **Project**. This is a convenient way within Rstudio to set your **Working Directory** for each lab assignment. Your Working Directory is where all of your code and data will be stored for each lab, and setting it by making an Rstudio Project tells your computer where (*i.e.*, in which folder) to start looking for stuff. Let's do this now by choosing **`File > New Project`** in the top menu of Rstudio. You'll then choose `Existing Directory` to associate your project with the unzipped `BISC204_Lab01` folder. When you set up an Rstudio project, the computer will know to use this directory that you established as your Working Directory.

Now that we've set up our project directory and are a bit acclimated to Rstudio, we'll make an R script document, which is where you will actually write the R code. The R script file is a text document that will save all your work as you produce code so that you don't have to type things over and over. Within Rstudio, select **`File > New File > R Script`** to open a new R script file. Then *immediately* go to `File > Save As`, and save your R script file the same name that you'll use to turn it in: `BISC204_Lab01_BANNERID.R` within the same `BISC204_Lab01` folder in the Rstudio server. Now you're ready to start making code in this R script file!

In an R script file, any line that starts with a hashtag is interpreted as a "comment". This means that the R program will ignore that line, but comments are extremely useful as notes to yourself and others who will read your code. Right now, type a hastag on the top line of your R script file with "BannerID: 12345678", followed by the date.

### 5. Introduction to the tidyverse
In this class, we'll make extensive use of the **tidyverse** package in R. One of the most powerful things about R is that it is an open-source language under constant development where scientists are contributing new packages of function libraries that can be useful to others. In this class, we'll learn to use the **tidyverse** package and libraries for data science, which is a cutting-edge set of tools whose powers are extensible to giant datasets. The tidyverse also creates an intuitive framework for large-scale data manipulation and beautiful visualization. 

Developers and users of the tidyverse are a generally lovely community of people who have developed extensive documentation and learning tools that you can find on the web. The tidyverse is the backbone of the [R for Data Science book](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) that we'll draw from in this course.

When you want to use a package in R for the very first time, you have to install it to your computer, but I've taken care of this already on the Rstudio sevrver (we'll learn how to install packages another day). When you want to use a package, you need to call the `library()` function as:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

You can put this on your second line of the R script file beneath your name, and **run** this line in Rstudio. To run a line of code in your R script file, you can either put your cursor on the line that you want to run and click the **`Run`** button at the top right of your R script panel, or you can hit `Command + Return` on a Mac or `Control + Enter` on a PC as a shortcut. You should see the command on that line show up in the Console window on the bottom right panel.

### 6. Loading data into Rstudio

Now we're ready to work with data! The dataset that we'll work with was aggregated by Dr. John Arbuthnot, an 18<sup>th</sup> century physician, writer, and mathematician. He was interested in the ratio of newborn boys to newborn girls (in biology this is called the sex ratio), so he gathered the baptism records for children born in London for every year from 1629 to 1710. 

The data are sitting in the **`data/`** folder in your BISC204_Lab01 directory, and we'll load it into Rstudio with the **`read_csv()`** function (this is from the tidyverse). When we write this command, the backwards arrow is sending the output of the `read_csv()` function to a new object in R that we're naming `arbuthnot`. In R, a backwards pointing arrow always indicates that you are creating a new object within the R environment. Making new objects is how you manipulate and use things within R.

```{r load-abrbuthnot-data, eval=TRUE}
arbuthnot <- read_csv("data/arbuthnot.csv")
```

You should see that the workspace area in the upper righthand corner of the RStudio window now lists a data set called `arbuthnot` that has 82 observations on 3 variables. As you interact with R, you will create a series of objects. Sometimes you load them as we have done here, and sometimes you create them yourself as the byproduct of a computation or some analysis you have performed. 

We can take a look at the data by typing its name into the console:

```{r view-data, eval=FALSE}
arbuthnot
```

What you should see are three columns of numbers, each row representing a different year: the first entry in each row is simply the row number (an index we can use to access the data from individual years if we want), the second is the year, and the third and fourth are the numbers of boys and girls baptized that year, respectively. Use the scrollbar on the right side of the console window to examine the complete data set.

R has stored Arbuthnot's data in a kind of spreadsheet or table called a *tibble* which is a type of *data frame*. You can see the dimensions of this data frame by typing:

```{r dim-data, eval=TRUE}
dim(arbuthnot)
```

This command should output `[1] 82 3`, indicating that there are 82 rows and 3 columns (we'll get to what the `[1]` means in a bit), just as it says next to the object in your Rstudio Environment panel. You can see the names of these columns (or variables) by typing:

```{r names-data, eval=TRUE}
names(arbuthnot)
```

You should see that the data frame contains the columns `year`,  `boys`, and `girls`. At this point, you might notice that many of the commands in R look a lot like functions from math class; that is, invoking R commands means supplying a function with some number of arguments. The `dim` and `names` commands, for example, each took a single argument, the name of a data frame. 

One advantage of RStudio is that it comes with a built-in data viewer. Click on the name `arbuthnot` in the *Environment* pane (upper right window) that lists  the objects in your workspace. This will bring up an alternative display of the data set in the *Data Viewer* (upper left panel). You can close the data viewer by clicking on the *x* in the upper lefthand corner.

### 7. Arbuthnot Data for Sex Ratios in Newborns, London 1629-1710

Let's start to examine the data a little more closely. We can access the data in a single column of a data frame separately using a command like

```{r view-boys, eval=FALSE}
arbuthnot$boys
```

This command will only show the number of boys baptized each year.

1.  What command would you use to extract just the counts of girls baptized? Try
    it!

Notice that the way R has printed these data is different. When we looked at the complete data frame, we saw 82 rows, one on each line of the display. These data are no longer structured in a table with other variables, so they are displayed one right after another. Objects that print out in this way are called *vectors*; they represent a set of numbers. R has added numbers in [brackets] along the left side of the printout to indicate locations within the vector. For example, `5218` follows `[1]`, indicating that `5218` is the first entry in the vector. And if `[43]` starts a line, then that would mean the first number on that line would represent the 43<sup>rd</sup> entry in the vector.

R has some powerful functions for making graphics through the tidyverse library called **ggplot**. This was the subject of your Pre-Lab reading, [Sections 3.1-3.6 in R4DS](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html). The structure of the ggplot function sends the tibble/data frame to be plotted, followed by a `geom` (plot type) with a `mapping` that specifies what to put on the x and y axes.

We can create a ggplot of the number of girls baptized per year with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = arbuthnot) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year, y = girls))
```

We could change this to a line plot by changing the `geom` piece to:

```{r plot-girls-vs-year, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = arbuthnot) + geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = girls))
```

2.  Is there an apparent trend in the number of girls baptized over the years?  
    How would you describe it?

Now, suppose we want to plot the total number of baptisms.  To compute this, we could use the fact that R is really just a big calculator. We can type in mathematical expressions like

```{r, eval=FALSE}
5218 + 4683
```

to see the total number of baptisms in 1629. We could repeat this over and over for each year, but there is a faster way. If we add the vector for baptisms for boys and girls, R will compute all sums simultaneously.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls
```

What you will see are 82 numbers (in that packed display, because we aren't looking at a data frame here), each one representing the sum we're after. Take a look at a few of them and verify that they are right. We can make this vector (the total number of baptisms) a new column in our `arbuthnot` data frame with the **`mutate()`** function from the tidyverse. We'll read more about mutate and other associated functions for manipulating data frames later on, but we'll use this here to get a jump on some analysis. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Over-write the arbuthnot object to add a new column to the data with mutate
arbuthnot <- mutate(arbuthnot, total = girls + boys)

# Look at the new data frame
arbuthnot
```

Now that this variable is in our data frame, we can make a plot of the total number of baptisms per year with the command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = arbuthnot) + geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = total)) 
```

Similarly to how we computed the total number of baptisms, we can also compute the ratio of the number of boys to the number of girls baptized in 1629 with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
5218 / 4683
```

Or, we can act on the complete vectors and add columns for the ratio of boys to girls to the data frame with the command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
arbuthnot <- mutate(arbuthnot, ratio = boys / girls)
```

We can similarly add columns to the data frame that reflect the proportion of boys and girls (relative to the total number of baptisms) in the data using mutate:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
arbuthnot <- mutate(arbuthnot, 
                    prop_boys = boys / total,
                    prop_girls = girls / total)
```


3.  Now, make a ggplot of the proportion of boys over time. What do you see? 

To exit RStudio you can click the *x* in the upper right corner of the whole window.  
You will be prompted to save your workspace. If you click *save*, RStudio will 
save the history of your commands and all the objects in your workspace so that 
the next time you launch RStudio, you will see `arbuthnot` and you will have 
access to the commands you typed in your previous session. For now, click *save*,
then start up RStudio again.

### Lab Report Questions

In the previous exercise, you recreated some of the displays and preliminary analysis of Arbuthnot's baptism data. Your assignment involves repeating these steps, but for present day birth records in the United States. Load up the present day data with the following command.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
present <- read_csv("data/present.csv")
```

The data are now loaded in a data frame called `present`.

-   What years are included in this data set? What are the dimensions of the 
    data frame and what are the variable or column names?

-   How do these counts compare to Arbuthnot's? Are they on a similar scale?

-   Make a plot that displays the boy-to-girl ratio for every year in the data 
    set. What do you see? Does Arbuthnot's observation about boys being born in
    greater proportion than girls hold up in the U.S. in present day? Include the plot in your 
    response.

-   In what year did we see the most total number of births in the U.S.? 

*Data Note:*
These data come from a report by the Centers for Disease Control 
[http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr53/nvsr53_20.pdf](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr53/nvsr53_20.pdf).
